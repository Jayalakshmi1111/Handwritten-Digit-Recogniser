# Handwritten-Digit-Recogniser
The MNIST is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.Here I have used Neural Network to build my model.
Packages need to be imported:
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Keras
OpenCV
Tensorflow
Steps:
We should download the MNIST dataset
We should do all the preprocessing the techniques 
Build the neural network with 3 layers, trained the model and saved the model as model.h5
Accuracy:
Accuracy of the model is 97%
After training the model using training dataset , test the model using your custom input images
The model will predict the handwritten input images.
